You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device.

  <em><b>In Short:</b> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties.</em><br><br>

  <b>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</b> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("<b>third parties</b>") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>Ad Networks</li>
    <li>Data Analytics Services</li>
    <li>Performance Monitoring Tools</li>
    <li>Sales & Marketing Tools</li>

    <li><b>Business Transfers</b>. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="my-3" id="cookies">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>

  <em><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em><br><br>

  We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

  <h3 class="my-3" id="info-time">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

  <em><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em><br><br>

  We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.<br><br>

  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

  <h3 class="my-3" id="info-safety">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

  <em><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em><br><br>

  We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

  <h3 class="my-3" id="privacy-rights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

  <h3 class="my-3" id="control-track">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

  <h3 class="my-3" id="cal-residents">9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
